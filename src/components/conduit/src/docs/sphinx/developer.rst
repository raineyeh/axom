Build System Info
-------------------

Configuring with CMake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conduit uses a CMake based build system. You can run CMake directly to configure an out-of-source build, or use the "config-build.sh" helper script, which does the following:

- Creates a fresh *build-debug* folder.
- Runs :bash:`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install-debug` from within the *build-debug* folder.


Important CMake Targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **make**: Builds the conduit library.

- **make test**: Runs conduit unit tests.

- **make docs**: Builds sphinx and doxygen documentation.

- **make install**: Installs the conduit library, headers, and documentation to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`

Adding a Unit Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Create a test source file in *src/tests*
- Add the test to build system by editing *src/tests/CMakeLists.txt*


Git Development Workflow 
------------------------

The master conduit source repository is hosted on LLNL's CZ Stash instance:

https://lc.llnl.gov/stash/projects/CON

We we are using a **Github Flow** model, which is a simpler variant of the confusing similar sounding **Git Flow** model.


Here are the basics: 

- Development is done on topic branches off the master.

- Merge to master is only done via a pull request.

- The master should always compile and pass all tests.

More details on GitHub Flow:

https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html

Here are some other rules to abide by:

- You *can* merge your own pull requests.

- After completing all intended work on branch, please delete the remote branch after merging to master. (Stash has an option to do this when merging a pull request.)
